            <h1 class="t">Why Blogger for Students?</h1>
            
            <p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blogging gives students the opportunities to speak their ‘unique voices’. Students can practice their communication and conversation skills when they comment on others’ postings or reply to others’ feedback on their blogs. Blogging can also help students be courteous and thoughtful.
            </p>
<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blogging develops students’ analytical thinking and increases learning to a higher level, not merely just “understanding” and "remembering” instructional materials. Before their thoughts can be written down, students need to analyze the subject and then clarify their thoughts about the subject. Then, they need to carefully formulate and stand by their own opinions. Blogging encourages students to contemplate how their opinions might be interpreted and reflected upon by others.
</p>        
<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blogging facilitates creative expression when they develop original content and layout of their blogs. Students can be creative in terms of customizing the themes, selecting relevant images or videos, and designing the layout. This is the visual platform in which students can express themselves. Blogging can turn learning into a fun process.
</p>         
<p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blogging involves a lot of writing. However, an improvement in writing skills doesn’t come automatically. Instructors need to give explicit directions at the beginning of the project as far as; step-by-step directions on how to blog, how to be authentic, how to support your opinions, as well as communicate expectations for the learner.

        <h1>REWARD SYSTEM</h1>
        <p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reward in e-learning gamification creates a sense of achievement and recognition among the learner that makes the
        learner feel -‘I won it’. Achievement is one of the most powerful psychological driving factors of human motivation to
        bring the desired behavior change.</p>
        <p class="font">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the learner understands that his/her right actions are rewarded and recognized, the learner is motivated to repeat
        the action or process that won him the rewards, finally leading to take the ownership of learning process. It creates a
        culture of responsibility as the learners will be more interested in something they feel they have ownership of.</p>
